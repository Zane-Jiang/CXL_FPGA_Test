Info: emif.emif.arch: Agilex EMIF IP requires EMIF Calibration IP to source its calbus clock and calbus conduit.
Info: emif.emif.arch: PHY and controller running at 2x the frequency of user logic for improved efficiency.
Info: emif.emif.arch: Placement of address/command pins must follow "DDR4 Scheme 1A: Component and DIMM (with A17)".
Info: emif.emif.arch: Interface estimated to require 2 I/O Bank(s) and 4 I/O PLL(s). This is only an estimation. Final usage depends on user pin location assignments and/or fitter behavior.
Info: emif.emif.arch: Valid memory frequencies for the current PLL reference clock of 100.0 MHz and user clock rate, in MHz: 1600.0, 1200.0, 800.0
Info: emif.emif.arch: For additional documentation about the interface, consult the *_readme.txt file after generation.
